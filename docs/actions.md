# Actions

Actions apply repeatable rules to incoming articles during crawling. For example,
a rule can bookmark release announcements or tag articles mentioning a project.
Each rule combines a text-matching condition with an action to perform when that
condition matches. Rules apply across your subscribed feeds and do not require
AI processing.

## Create an action

1. Open **Settings → Actions**.
2. Select **Add Action**.
3. Enter a descriptive **Name** so you can recognize the rule later.
4. Choose the **Type**, such as **Assign tag** or **Set favorite**.
5. Enter a **Regular Expression** to identify matching articles.
6. For **Assign tag**, also enter the **Tag value** to add.
7. Select **Save Changes** to save your rules.

You can edit the fields of an existing rule or use its trash button to remove
it. Select **Save Changes** after editing or removing rules as well.

## Example: assign a tag to incoming articles

To collect articles mentioning Verstappen under one tag, add a rule with:

- **Name:** Verstappen news
- **Type:** Assign tag
- **Tag value:** `verstappen`
- **Regular Expression:** `/verstappen/i`

When an incoming article contains “Verstappen” in any checked field, RSSMonster
adds the `verstappen` tag. The `i` flag makes the match case-insensitive, so
“VERSTAPPEN” also matches. The tag is added alongside the article's other tags.

Select the tag on an article or in the sidebar to find related articles, or
search for `tag:verstappen`. See [Tags]({% link tag.md %}) for more ways to organize
and find tagged articles.

## Example: mark matching articles as favorites

To save incoming articles mentioning Nintendo or Zelda, add another rule with:

- **Name:** Save Nintendo and Zelda news
- **Type:** Set favorite
- **Regular Expression:** `/nintendo|zelda/i`

The `|` means “or,” so either word is enough to match. RSSMonster automatically
bookmarks matching articles, making them available in **Favorites** in the
sidebar. Setting a favorite does not itself mark the article as read. See
[Bookmarks]({% link bookmarks.md %}) for more about favorites.

To both tag and favorite the same articles, create two actions with the same
regular expression: one with **Assign tag**, and one with **Set favorite**.

## Available actions

| Type | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Discard article | Store a filtered record hidden from normal queries; skip AI analysis for that entry. This is not physical deletion. |
| Set favorite | Bookmark the article. |
| Mark as read | Set its read state. |
| Mark as clicked | Set its clicked/read-later indicator. |
| Mark as advertisement | Override the advertisement score to `0`; this score measures absence of advertising, so lower means more promotional. |
| Mark as low quality | Override the quality score to `0`. |
| Assign tag | Add the supplied tag. |

## Writing a rule

Use a JavaScript regular expression, either a plain pattern or `/pattern/flags`.
Plain patterns are case-sensitive; `/release|changelog/i` matches either word
without regard to case. For a whole word, use `/\bsecurity\b/i`.

The crawler tests available HTML content, plain text, title, description, and URL
separately. A match in any field is enough. Anchors such as `^` and `$` apply to
an individual field, not to all fields joined together. Invalid expressions are
rejected when saving; a blank expression does not match anything.

Rules run in list order. Several matching actions can apply, but a matching
Discard stops further action evaluation. Score overrides remain effective when
analysis results are applied. Saving rules does not launch a historical
reprocessing job, so do not expect existing stored articles to change immediately.

## Choose the right kind of filter

| Goal | Feature |
| --- | --- |
| Find stored articles by date, state, or score | [Search]({% link search.md %}) |
| Keep a reusable search | [Smart Folders]({% link smart-folders.md %}) |
| Accept only certain future entries from one feed | [Feed item filters]({% link feed-item-filters.md %}) |
| Apply a state, tag, or score rule during crawling | Actions |

Search tokens such as `quality:>0.7` are not action conditions. Actions match
text using regular expressions; use search and Smart Folders for score-based
selection. The API's `POST /api/actions` replaces the complete rule list, so
integrations should load the existing list before editing it.

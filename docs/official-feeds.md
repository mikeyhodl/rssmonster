# Official Feeds

Official Feeds help you recognize articles published on an organization's own
domains. You manage these domain rules in **Settings → Official Sources**.
During crawling, RSSMonster checks an article's URL against your enabled rules
and records the matching organization. The article's source signal is labeled
**Official Feed**, with the organization name when available.

This is useful for identifying company announcements, product updates, and
other direct sources among the wider coverage in your subscriptions. The rules
belong to your account and work without AI processing.

## Add an official source

1. Open **Settings → Official Sources**.
2. Select **Add Source**.
3. Enter the **Organization**, such as `Nintendo`.
4. Enter its **Domain**, such as `nintendo.com`.
5. Leave **Enabled** switched on.
6. Select **Save Changes**.

Use a separate row for each domain an organization publishes on. Several
domains can share the same organization name. Each domain has one saved
configuration in your account.

Adding an official source configures how articles are recognized. Subscribe to
the organization's feed through **Add new feed** to receive its articles. See
[Feeds and Categories]({% link feeds-and-categories.md %}) for subscription management.

## How domain matching works

RSSMonster uses the hostname of the article's URL. A configured domain matches
both that domain and its subdomains. Domain matching ignores capitalization
and a leading `www.`; you do not need a wildcard to include subdomains.

For a source configured as `nintendo.com`:

| Article URL | Matches? |
| --- | --- |
| `https://www.nintendo.com/us/news/article` | Yes |
| `https://news.nintendo.com/article` | Yes |
| `https://example.com/news/nintendo` | No |
| `https://notnintendo.com/article` | No |

A mention of the organization in an article's title or body does not make it an
official source. The article must link to a matching domain. Matching uses the
article URL rather than the address from which the RSS feed was fetched.

Enter a domain without a path. If you paste a full URL, RSSMonster keeps its
hostname, so a path such as `/news/` does not limit the rule to that section.
When several enabled domains match, the most specific matching domain wins.
For example, `news.example.com` takes precedence over `example.com`.

## What changes on an article

Matching articles are stored with an official-source indicator and the
configured organization name. This supplies a source label such as
**Official Feed (Nintendo)** in the article's signals.

The organization name is stored as source metadata. Although the settings
introduction describes organization tagging, the current crawl implementation
does not automatically add it to the article's searchable tags. Use feed tags
or an **Assign tag** [Action]({% link actions.md %}) when you also want a
[tag]({% link tag.md %}) for filtering.

Official status reflects your configured domain list. It does not verify an
article's factual accuracy or replace [FeedTrust]({% link feedtrust.md %}), which
estimates a source's value from article and reading signals.

## Edit or disable a source

Edit the organization or domain directly in its row. Switch **Enabled** off to
keep the configuration while excluding it from matching, or use the trash
button to remove the row. Select **Save Changes** to persist edits, disabled
states, or removals.

Rules are used when new articles and article revisions are processed during
crawling. Saving the list does not reclassify the existing library immediately,
and disabling or removing a source does not itself clear labels already stored
on articles.
